## How to build

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:1138](http://localhost:1138) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
Now you can simply open `build/index.html` in your browser.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
